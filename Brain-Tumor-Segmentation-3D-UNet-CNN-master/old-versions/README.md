# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-3D-UNet-CNN

## old versions:
When I originally made this project, I was iterating quickly and creating new notebooks so that I could test things side-by-side. This is about as far from version control best practices as there is. I'm aware of this. Future projects will be properly version controlled.

### Current top level version:
BraTS_3DUNetCNN-cropping-v3-checking-predictions-callbacks-multiout-extra-layers-3preds-sequential-v5-pickle-crops.ipynb

### Hopefully the best model weights for the current version of the single prediction architecture (see note above concerning version control best practices):
best_model.hdf5

### Old top level version had a missing y2 variable assignment:
BraTS_3DUNetCNN-cropping-v3-checking-predictions-callbacks-multiout-local.ipynb
